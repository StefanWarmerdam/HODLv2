# Contributing

## Contribute to HODLv2

Feel like our bot is missing a feature? We welcome your pull requests! 

Label [issues](https://github.com/p0ntsNL/hodlv2/issues) are a good initial contributions, and will help get you familiar with the codebase.

Few pointers for contributions:

- Create your PR against the `main`.
- New features must be checked with black, isort and pylint (PEP8 compliant), a workflow runs automatically on every PR.
- PR's can be declared as `[WIP]` - which signify Work in Progress Pull Requests (which are not finished).

If you are unsure, discuss the feature in a [issue](https://github.com/p0ntsNL/hodlv2/issues) before a Pull Request.

## Getting started

Best start by reading the [documentation](https://github.com/p0ntsNL/hodlv2/wiki) to get a feel for what is possible with the bot.

## (Core)-Committer Guide

### Process: Pull Requests

Ensure that each pull request meets all requirements in the Contributing document.

### Process: Issues

If an issue is a bug that needs an urgent fix, mark it for the next patch release.
Then either fix it or mark as please-help.

For other issues: encourage friendly discussion, moderate debate, offer your thoughts.

### Process: Your own code changes

All code changes, regardless of who does them, need to be reviewed and merged by someone else.
This rule applies to all the core committers.

Exceptions:

- Minor corrections and fixes to pull requests submitted by others.
- While making a formal release, the release manager can make necessary, appropriate changes.
- Small documentation changes that reinforce existing subject matter. Most commonly being, but not limited to spelling and grammar corrections.

### Responsibilities

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac & Linux.
- Ensure no malicious code is introduced into the core code.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the Python Community Code of Conduct (https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

### Becoming a Committer

Contributors may be given commit privileges. Preference will be given to those with:

1. Past contributions to HODLv2 and other related open-source projects. Contributions to HODLv2 include both code (both accepted and pending) and friendly participation in the issue tracker and Pull request reviews. Quantity and quality are considered.
1. A coding style that the other core committers find simple, minimal, and clean.
1. Access to resources for cross-platform development and testing.
1. Time to devote to the project regularly.

Being a Committer does not grant write permission on `develop` or `main` for security reasons (Users trust HODLv2 with their Exchange API keys).

After being Committer for some time, a Committer may be named Core Committer and given full repository access.
